### Hi there 👋 
I'm a first year student at The University of Ontario 🚀 studying computer science. I 
enjoy talking about tech and all cs related. Send me a message if you ever want to talk!

Currently, I'm working on a notes hub to keep my notes I create on the internet organized and my lecturespeeder script to generate better pdfs for school efficiency in order to spend more time on the things I enjoy.
