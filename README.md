### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 19-year-old student entering my third year at The University of Western Ontario ðŸš€ studying computer science. I develop projects that interest me, mainly in Python. Keep track of what I'm doing on my website [now page](http://www.andysit.com/_now_index/).

You can find me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/221336351478513664), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-sit/), and my andysit173@gmail.com.
